## About Me

Hi, I’m Jacob Munoz — an engineer and developer passionate about robotics, control systems, navigation, path planning, SLAM, and applied machine learning.  
Recently graduated with a Master’s in Robotics and a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering, I enjoy bridging hardware integration, algorithm design, and reproducible workflows, with clear documentation that makes complex systems accessible.

### Why I Build
I enjoy tackling projects that challenge me to think creatively and push the limits of robotics and automation.  
My goal is to design systems that are technically sound, reproducible, and useful for others.
